# Cricket score prediction for limited over matches using dl
 The cricket score prediction for limited-over matches based on deep learning is that it trains models such as LSTM networks on historical match data that includes player statistics and match conditions. These models capture temporal dependencies and patterns, and based on past sequences and the current match context, enable accurate predictions of future scores. This enhances the strategic decision-making during the matches.
